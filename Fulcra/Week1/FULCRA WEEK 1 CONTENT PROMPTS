FULCRA WEEK 1 CONTENT PROMPTS
(For: 3 Static Posts • 2 Reels • 5 Stories)

🟦 MONDAY – Static Post: Fulcra Focus
Prompt:
 Introduce the concept of leverage in leadership — how great leaders use influence, systems, or people to create impact beyond their own effort.
Suggested Caption Angle:
“Leadership leverage isn’t about doing more — it’s about doing the right things that create more impact.”
 Ask: “Where are you trying to push without a fulcrum in place?”
Visual Style Guidance:
 Blueprint or architectural lever sketch. Use Fulcra blue, clean lines, and a bold statement in the center like:
 "Leaders don't push harder. They build smarter."

🟦 WEDNESDAY – Static Post: Leadership in Action
Prompt:
 Use a metaphor or short scenario that shows the power of delegating vs doing it all yourself.
Suggested Caption Angle:
“Imagine building a bridge — but carrying every beam yourself. That’s what leadership without trust looks like.”
 End with: “Real leadership means knowing what not to carry.”
Visual Style Guidance:
 Bridge metaphor. Could be an image of construction, teamwork, or someone holding too much. Clean, striking design.

🟦 FRIDAY – Static Post: Friday Framework
Prompt:
 End the week with a leadership check-in: “What is your biggest lever right now — the one thing that creates movement everywhere else?”
Suggested Caption Angle:
“Not all effort is equal. Focus your energy where it creates the biggest shift.”
 Invite reflection: “What’s your leadership lever this week?”
Visual Style Guidance:
 Minimalist. Use graphic of a lever in motion, or a central object shifting other pieces (like a fulcrum in action).

🎥 TUESDAY REEL – Blueprint Breakdown
Prompt:
 Define the word “Alignment” in leadership. Why it matters. How misalignment affects teams.
Suggested Caption Angle (script or overlay):
“Alignment = When vision, strategy, and execution pull in the same direction. Without it? Progress slows. Conflict grows. And burnout spreads.”
Visual Guidance:
 Use animated arrows, blueprint graphics, or stick with clean text animation and voiceover.

🎥 THURSDAY REEL – This is Leadership
Prompt:
 Tell a short, common moment that quietly shows leadership in motion (like listening before responding, recognizing someone’s effort, or staying calm under stress).
Suggested Caption Angle (script or overlay):
“When you pause to understand before you fix — that’s leadership.”
 Or:
 “When your presence calms a room — that’s leadership.”
Visual Guidance:
 Footage of a calm leader, thoughtful team moments, or abstract images with bold text overlays.
