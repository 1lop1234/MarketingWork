Reels (Tues + Thurs)
TUESDAY – Blueprint Breakdown
Topic: Alignment in Leadership
Purpose:
To break down a key leadership concept from the Fulcra framework in a quick, digestible format. This series should feel like the "instruction manual" side of leadership — giving clarity and teaching with precision.
Tone:
Direct
Educational
Strategic
Polished but conversational
 (Think: You’re a leadership architect pointing out what makes the structure stand.)
Examples (Script or Caption Style):
“Let’s break down alignment: It’s when your team’s vision, strategy, and execution are all pulling in the same direction.”
“Misalignment is like building with a crooked foundation — it slows progress, creates tension, and eventually leads to collapse.”
“Ask yourself: Are your actions aligned with your priorities this week? If not, realignment starts with you.”
Visual Guidance:
Motion graphics (arrows aligning, gears locking, blueprint sketches)
Minimalist text overlays or voiceover on stock footage
Fulcra-branded fonts and color scheme
Can start with the hook: “Let’s break this down.”







THURSDAY – This is Leadership
Topic: Calm, Presence, and Listening as Leadership
Purpose:
To spotlight everyday leadership in action — not the flashy moments, but the ones that reveal character, composure, and influence. These videos are emotional and relatable.
Tone:
Reflective
Authentic
Grounded
A bit cinematic or emotional
 (Think: "Leadership isn’t loud. It’s steady.")


Examples (Script or Caption Style):
“When your calm sets the tone for the whole team — that’s leadership.”
“When you listen first instead of rushing to fix — that’s leadership.”
“You won’t always have the answers. But your presence can be the anchor your team needs.”


Visual Guidance:
Slow-motion clips of thoughtful people, team discussions, leaders observing
Clean overlays: big text, soft animation, quiet music
Could feature a question sticker in the caption: “What’s a leadership moment that changed how you lead?”
